### Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed to close the loophole that exists for software used on network servers. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" if it includes a convenient feature that displays a copyright notice and tells the user that the work has no warranty.
